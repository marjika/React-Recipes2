# React Recipes

### A Recipe Search Engine using Recipe Puppy API

A simple single page React application to search recipes.

##### About this Application

React Recipes was created by my university bootcamp with some changes made by me so I could practice styling with the "styled-components" npm. React Recipes was created in January and February 2019. This project is maintained by me, Marjika Howarth.  It is deployed at "https://glacial-cliffs-80795.herokuapp.com/".
